<p>42 Minishell is a team project I did with <a href= "https://github.com/Kingsolomon445">(@ofadahun)</a> as a part of Core curriculum at 42 Heilbronn. In this project, we built a mini version of bash that handled pipe, redirection, parsing, tokenizing, child processes, proper exit codes and following builtins:</p> 
<br>✅ echo with option -n
<br>✅ cd with only a relative or absolute path 
<br>✅ pwd with no options
<br>✅ export with no options
<br>✅ unset with no options
<br>✅ env with no options or arguments
<br>✅ exit with no options
<br>
