42 Minishell is a team project I did with . In this project, we built a mini version of bash that handled pipe, redirection, parsing, process, proper exit codes and following builtins: 
◦ echo with option -n
◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path ◦ pwd with no options
◦ export with no options
◦ unset with no options
◦ env with no options or arguments
◦ exit with no options
